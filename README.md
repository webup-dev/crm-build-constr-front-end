# Repository for demo-purposes
## What things I'd like to pay attention
This is front-end only. Back-end is in another repository. Front-end is based on the Vuejs (v2). 
### CHANGELOG.md
It uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Commits are frequent to give the client an ability to see current development status (Constant Viewable Development, CVD).
There is a full description of each version.

### API documentation
Front end uses API from back-end server.

[API documentation](http://codeci.pp.ua/docs/index.html).

### Views
Views use CoreUI template, based on well-known AdminLTE.

### Directory structure
+ API endpoints: /src/api
+ Components: /src/components
+ Router: /src/router
+ Views: /src/views
+ constants, containers, mixins, shared directories: /src.
